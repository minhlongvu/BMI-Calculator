# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

A BMI calculator app I coded using Flutter/Dart and based off starter code from [Angela Yu's (in collaboration with the Google Flutter team) Flutter course](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/).

Inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator).
